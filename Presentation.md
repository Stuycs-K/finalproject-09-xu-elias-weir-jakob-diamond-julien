# Buffer Overflows

## What are buffer overflows

### The Basics (Jakob)

- Overwrites of memory through overfilling evaluated memory space

### Why can buffer overflows be bad

- Can lead to exploits where overwrites of variables and function pointers, along with the functions themselves, can cause unintended behavior.

### Methods

- Heap based exploits
- Stack Based Exploits 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4700998/explain-stack-overflow-and-heap-overflow-in-programming-with-example 

## Demos

- Working demo (Elias)
- Basic Variable Overwriting (Elias)
- Changing the function pointer (Elias)
    - using payloads to change pointers
- Adding shellcode to binary

### Demo 4 (Julien)
#### Stack Background ####
- **Stack Frame** is one procedure on the call stack
  - parameters
  - **return address** is where execution should return when stack frame is completed (can be exploited!)
  - old **frame pointer** (pointer from which other elements in the frame can be accessed)
  - local variables

### Protection Methods (Julien)

- **Address space layout randomization (ASLR)** randomizes the memory addresses of certain data points involved in a process each time it is run
- **Stack canaries** are known values placed around a buffer such that they would be corrupted in the event of a buffer overflow

### Morris Worm (Julien)

- famous exploit released November 2nd, 1988
    - used buffer overflows (among other exploitation methods)
    - used known source code of fingerd to overwrite return address in stack frame (same as demo 4)
    - executes code segment that creates a new shell (as root)

#### Loony Tunables

Loony Tunables is a bug within the glibc package that doesn't account for malicious formatting of the `GLIBC_TUNABLES` variable. Glibc deals with .so, and the part that we're concerned about relates to malformed input for the c code to relate to the malformed pair. For example, usually the format for each tunable is `tunable1=AAA`. When it is instead misformed with an additional `=` sign, the pointer in line 247 doesn't change and it will overflow. 

```c
162 static void
163 parse_tunables (char *tunestr, char *valstring)

#### Tryhackme Shell Exploit + Explanation

- Hard for a cyber student of our level to understand
- We are given code that takes an input and puts it into a char array, but can overflow
- This overflow can be manipulated to output Assembly commands
- The program has the SUID bit, so it can be run as the user
- Through use of Assembly, you can switch users to the owner of the file
- The code exploited is this code, and the goal is to switch to user with ID 1002:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void copy_arg(char *string)
{
    char buffer[140];
    strcpy(buffer, string);
    printf("%s\n", buffer);
    return 0;
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    printf("Here's a program that echo's out your input\n");
    copy_arg(argv[1]);
}
```
- To exploit the code:
    - Use gdb to find the memory location of the buffer
        - First, 
    - As the input, put in an arbitrary number of
