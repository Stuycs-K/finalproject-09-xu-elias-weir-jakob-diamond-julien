# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Julien Diamond, Jakob Weir, Elias Xu

# Intentions:

Our project deals with analyzing the arbitrary code execution bug using overflowing buffers.

# Intended usage:

As of now, we're planning to have a video and a report about this, and a program that can exploit software of something like this. 
  
# Technical Details:

1. We going to have multiple demos that can all run on marge. 
    - The first one will initiate a basic stack overflow
    - The second one will cause a variable change through buffer overflow and also bypass traditional buffer overflow protections.


    
# Intended pacing:

1. Learn more about what this is. (This weekend)
    - Learn more about famous / interesting hacks using this method
    - Current issues and mitigations
2. Create a demo (Beginnings of next week to end of next week)
    - Create an arbitrary code execution software that can run commands
3. Make a presentation (Week after that)
    - Why does this happen?
    - How does one mitigate this?
    - How can you detect these issues and exploit them?
