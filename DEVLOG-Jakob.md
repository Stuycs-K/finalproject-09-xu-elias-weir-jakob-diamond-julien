Spent class time doing TryHackMe on buffer overflow.

### 2025-05-19 - THM Continued
Tried to continue TryHackMe, but had trouble figuring out how to run the C code properly.

### 2025-05-20 - Further look into THM
Caught up absent group member, successfully ran C code, looked at ways to complete next part, including seeing memory addresses.

### 2025-05-22 - Further THM research
Got an understanding of how to find and manipulate stacks. Learned some from https://medium.com/@cyberlarry/walkthrough-tryhackme-buffer-overflows-task-7-overwriting-function-pointers-ac1336979261.

### 2025-05-23 - Running on lab computers
Ran some of the TryHackMe code on lab computers to test buffer overflow there after much trial and error.
